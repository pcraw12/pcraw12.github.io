    I am a graduate student at Virginia Tech and am passionate about statistics, computer science, and finance.
    Currently, I am a teaching assistant for an intermediate data analytics and machine learning course.
    Last year I graduated from Brigham Young University and interned over the summer at Zions Bank as a model risk
    analyst intern. This coming summer I will be interning with U.S. Bank as a quantitative model analyst. I will
    be working within their credit risk team.
