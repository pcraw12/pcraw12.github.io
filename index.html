    I am a graduate student at Virginia Tech and am passionate about statistics, computer science, and finance. <br />
    Currently, I am a teaching assistant for an intermediate data analytics and machine learning course. <br />
    Last year I graduated from Brigham Young University and interned over the summer at Zions Bank as a model risk <br />
    analyst intern. This coming summer I will be interning with U.S. Bank as a quantitative model analyst. I will <br />
    be working within their credit risk team.
